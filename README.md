# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
•	Software engineering is the art of developing working computer software on time and on budget.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
•	Development of programming language, software engineering accepted as a discipline, and the rise of structured programming and agile methods


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
•	Collection of requirements where we ask the product owner what they want.
•	Designing the actual software based on the requirements.
•	Writing the actual software
•	Testing the software to ensure that it is bug-free
•	Deploying the software for use
•	Maintaining the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
•	Waterfall is a sequential methodology of software development that is structured based on the software development life cycle. It would be ideal for large projects that require building something from scratch and where the product owner knows exactly what they want.
•	Agile methodology relies more on developing software in stages called sprints where a sprint is focused on developing only specific components of a software. It is very ideal where the product owner has a rough idea of what the want.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
•	A Software Developer writes the code
•	A Quality Assurance Engineer reviews the completed software to ensure that it meets the user requirements and is bug-free
•	A Project Manager ensures that the software is developed on time and on budget while coordinating all the participants

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
•	IDEs allow for easy-to-use coding language as opposed to using actual machine code.
•	Version code allows for tracking of all changes made to a software as the developers iterate over improvements and changes that they make.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
•	Tight deadlines which can be resolved through constant communication with the stakeholders on current status of the project
•	Limited Budget which can be resolved by ensuring the project manager keeps an updated track of all expenditure.
•	Technical debt because of shortcuts or lack of documentation. This can be resolved by making sure developers get it right the first time by using version control and proper documentation.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
•	Unit testing focuses on ensuring each component of a software works.
•	Integration testing focuses on ensuring that the software can integrate seamlessly with existing software.
•	System testing focuses on ensuring that the entire software works.
•	Acceptance testing focuses on ensuring that the software meets the users requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
•	Prompt engineering revolves around knowing how to structure your questions to get the best response from AI model. It ensures that the AI does not give general answers while also avoiding confusion.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
•	If the time now is 3, what time is it in America?
•	If the time now is 3PM EAT, wat time is it in California?
